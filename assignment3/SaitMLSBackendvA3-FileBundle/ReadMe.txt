Instructions for installing the Assignment3SaitMLS.zip download.

1. Unzip the contents into your assignment 3 directory.

2. The jar file named saitMLSBackendA3.jar is to be placed
   in the lib directory as a jar file (DO NOT EXTRACT).

3. The clients.txt, comprop.txt and resprop.txt files are to be placed 
   in the res directory.  The program will generate other files that
   will be placed in this directory once your program is running 
   (DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THESE FILES).

4. The Javadoc for the backend is in "SaitMLSBackendvA3-Javadoc.zip". 
   Extract this to the "lib" folder as a subdirectory. This is the javadoc 
   documentation of the classes your gui will use to communicate with 
   the backend jar file.

5. The file ClientScreen.jpg is an example of what the GUI screens should contain as
   components but not exactly how these screens have to look.
