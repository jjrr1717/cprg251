When the app is opened it defaults to the client panel. 
From the client panel a search can be completed by Id, Firstname, Lastname, Phone Number, 
Postal Code and Type. Clicking search will display the results.  To do another
search, click on the clear button and search again.  To see more details of an item
selecting it from the JList will populate the fields in the right panel with
the item's information. An item can be modified by just typing or selecting new 
information. A new item can also be added by entering new information.  The
save button will either save a new item or save a modified item. The delete 
button will remove an item.  The clear button will clear the screen.

80 characters.  Phone number must be in the format xxx-xxx-xxxx and postal code

Both of these panels contain the same functionality as the client panel, with
some few and minor differences. 

The residential panel allows a user to search by Id, Asking Price, Number of 
Bedrooms, Number of Bathrooms, Quadrant, and Zone.  Searching by asking price will
show results that greater than the value entered.  Legal Description must be in the

Number of Floors, Quadrant, or Zone.  It has similar properties as the client and 
residential panels with few differences. Type can be either O for office or 
M for manufacturing.

all the changes made during the session.
